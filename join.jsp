        	<h2>Join the JForum team</h2>
           	<p>Ok, so you want to help JForum, and are asking yourself how and where to start. Here's how:</p>

		<div class="blue-title"><strong>First option: Are you a Java programmer?</strong></div>
		<div><img src="imgs/bg_hr.png" width="100%" height="5"></div>
<p>Most of the people who wants to participate on JForum are interested in developing it - it means, changing the source code to add new features, fix bugs or improve something. For those, a good experience with Java (the technology, not just the language) is a must-have. You have to be able to understand and correctly write good Java code. Expect to work on a lot of different libraries and frameworks.</p>
		
		<div class="blue-title"><strong>Second option: Are you a web designer?</strong></div>
		<div><img src="imgs/bg_hr.png" width="100%" height="5"></div>
<p>People are visual. We love colors and usable things. An excellent and very welcome way to help JForum is to design images and / or templates (CSS included) to give users more options for their boards. And that's only one tiny part of the process. There are a lot of work to do, and help on this is very welcome.</p>

		<div class="blue-title"><strong>How to join?</strong></div>
		<div><img src="imgs/bg_hr.png" width="100%" height="5"></div>
<p>First of all, introduce yourself in the <a href="http://www.jforum.net/forums/show/3.page">General Development forum</a>. Just create a new thread there telling us who you are and how you can help us.</p>
<p>That's all. Be prepared to answer some questions that may arrive.</p> 

		<div class="blue-title"><strong>And how what?</strong></div>
		<div><img src="imgs/bg_hr.png" width="100%" height="5"></div>
<p>We'll start a contact and, sometimes, you'll join the <a href="team.jsp">JForum team</a>.</p>
